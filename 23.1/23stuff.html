      //         Front-end development
      // JavaScript – fundamentals of this
      // The following exercise contains the following subjects:
      // ● context
      // Instructions
      // Answer the following questions:
      // Question 1:
      // In your own words what will this point to and why?
      // (Note this is the global scope)
      //   console.log(this);
      //this refers to the window object

      // Question 2:
      // a. In your own words what will this point to and why?
      //It will point to the global object because the arrow function doesn't suppot this
      // b. How can you fix this code?
      // Change the function unto a regular one.
      //   const myObj = {
      //     name: "Timmy",
      //     greet: function() {
      //       console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);
      //     },
      //   };
      //   console.log(myObj);
      // myObj.greet();
      // Question 3:
      // In your own words what will this point to and why?
      // In the code provided, myFuncDec is declared as an anonymous function. The behavior of the this keyword in JavaScript functions depends on how the function is called.
      //If this function is called in the global context or without any specific context, this will typically refer to the global object, which is window in a web browser environment or global in Node.js.
      const myFuncDec = function () {
        console.log(this);
      };
      // Question 4:
      // In your own words what will this point to and why?
      // this function will refer to the global window object becuase arrow function doesn't support this
      const myFuncArrow = () => {
        console.log(this);
      };
      myFuncArrow();
      // Question 5:
      // a. In your own words, what will this point to and why?
      // Due to it being an arrow function it will point to the global object instead of the
      //the dom element the was selected using the selector.
      // b. How can you fix this code?
      // to fix it we need to change the arrow function to a regular callback function
      // document.querySelector(".element").addEventListener(() => {
      // console.log(this);
      // }); -->
